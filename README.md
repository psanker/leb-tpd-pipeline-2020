This is the repository containing an internal presentation about the
Lebanon TPD Data Pipeline project, an example of future continuous
integration work to streamline data flow for transparency and
reproducibility.

Installation
------------

If you’d like to play around with the materials here, do these tasks:

1.  `git clone` this repo into your folder of choice (you can also use
    the `Code > Download ZIP...` button).
2.  Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
3.  Run this command in the console:

<!-- -->

    source("install.R")

That should install all of the packages needed to build this
presentation and run the example drake workflow.
